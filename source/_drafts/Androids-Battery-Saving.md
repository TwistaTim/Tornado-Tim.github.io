If you use a Android phone for CGM collection and/or APS. You may know the basics to turn off battery saving.

Apps such as xDrip Plus and AndroidAPS will exempt themselves on setup so they don't shutdown because android thinks its good.

It is also worthwhile checking if you phone has any 'additional' battery saving features and if you can turn them off as well. 'Additional' meaning they go beyond the stock Android Implementation such as battery saving apps etc.
