# Nightscout Foundation

So a little announcement that it is now public, I have joined the Nightscout Foundation Board as a **Director of Development**.

For those who don’t know what this Nightscout thing is:

The **Nightscout Foundation** is a non-for-profit 501C organization based in the United States that has worldwide reach and has been directly behind the **#WeAreNotWaiting** movement since 2012.

It spawned many other movements in other countries — and me and a bunch of like-minded individuals in NZ started the **Nightscout New Zealand** charitable organisation in 2019.

## #WeAreNotWaiting

**#WeAreNotWaiting** is about pushing technical boundaries to get better health outcomes for people with Diabetes and not waiting for industry to catch up.

Many of the devices that have come to market have been shaped by the many wonderful individuals who have contributed to projects such as:

- OpenAPS  
- Trio  
- Loop  
- AndroidAPS  
- xDrip  
- CGM in the cloud (known as Nightscout)

Developers and community builders — you know who you guys are.

You men and women behind these life-changing projects are the beating heart of our community. I want to support you all in any way that I can via NSF.

## Looking Ahead

The NSF have some ideas and they follow on from the fantastic success we had at the **Hack 2025**.

Some exciting news:

**Hack 2026 will be happening!**
